	<h2>1. Fashion Design<br></h2>
	</a>
	As a primary degree, I have studied fashion. Through out the 4 years of studies, not only I have learned to illustrate, design, and make clothes, but to promote the brand and market the products. Interest in fashion marketing has further reached the interest in business field which led to my later studies, business.<br><br>

	<h2><br><br>2. Business Administration<br></h2></a>
		Among the business fields, my focus was mainly marketing and human resource fields. I have studied courses such as followings; 'Consumer behaviour', 'Human resource management and business strategy', 'Business communication'. Most of my studies of business was done in Australia since I have done my exchange program at the 'Australian National University', one of the most prestigious universities in the world. While studying in Australia, I have fell in love with the culture and the country. I had a chance to participate in the competition by Samsung Card and as a winning prize, went on a business trip with the teammates to make a promotion video for Samsung Card and Queensland.<br><br>

	<h2><br><br>3. Computer Science<br></h2>
	</a>
	After studying in Australia, I wanted to learn more professional skills that are not replaceable. Meanwhile, I have further developed my interest in the technology which eventually led my attention to the software engineering field. I am currently studying Computer Science, doing my second year. My biggest interest for now is <italic>database </italic>and <italic>big data</italic>. I want to work in experimenting, revolutionary, and challenging companies such as <strong><a href="https://www.allsaints.com/" target="_blank">'ALLSAINTS'</strong></a>, and <strong><a href="https://www.hm.com/entrance.ahtml?orguri=%2F" target="_blank">'H&M'</a></strong>.

	<h2><a id="section2"><br><br>Languages</a></h2>
	</p>

	<p>
	<h3>English<br></h3>
	I am highly fluent in English. Gone to the specialised highschool in Korea, I majored in English for three years of highschool. Unlike ordinary highschool, I was able to take courses such as English debating, conversation, grammar, literature courses etc.<br>Moreover, working for the international office at my university for 2 years, I was exposed in the environment that I had to speak to people from all over the world.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	<h3>French<br></h3>
	Having french as a second major back in highschool, I had not only took basic french courses but also had opportunities to take conversation courses with the native french teachers. Being interested in the culture, I have continued studying french in university as well and got the certificate of B1.
